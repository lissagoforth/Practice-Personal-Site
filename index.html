            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <article id="background" class="article">
                <p>I was born and raised in Nashville, TN. I attended MTSU and graduated with 
            a degree in Psychology with a minor in Sociology. I originally had the 
            intention of going to graduate school for Behavioral Neuroscience. 
            However, when faced with the question of what I wanted to research specifically 
            I came up short. I decided to postpone grad school and focus on repaying the 
            student loans I already had instead of racking up even more debt. Fast forward 5 years
            and I was still just working to pay bills and hadn't settled into a career.
            This was very uncomfortable for me. I had this persistent feeling of under-achievment.
            I began looking for any way to break the cycle. That is how I found my way to Nashville 
            software School. Software development seemed to offer nearly an infinte number of career
            options. That alone was enough to convince me to start learning how to code. Plus,
            given the nature of technology, it seemed very likely to me that I would eventually be
            able to pursue neuroscience via programming the nano technology that will be able to
            interact with the human body to track biometrics and much more.</p>
